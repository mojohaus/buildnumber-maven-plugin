    <faq id="missing-scm">
      <question>Can the plugin be used on a project without an SCM connection?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Yes, set the plugin parameter </p> <source> &lt;revisionOnScmFailure&gt;</source> <p>to prevent 
        the plugin from throwing an exception if SCM information is not found.</p>
        <p>The other option is to use <source>-Dmaven.buildNumber.ignoreEmptyScmUrl=true -Dmaven.buildNumber.scmProvider=git/svn/</source>
        Default is git</p>
      </answer>
